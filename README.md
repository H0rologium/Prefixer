# Prefixer
Prefixer is a simple java program that adds a specified string to the beginning of each line.

You can use this program by running it from the command line with the following arguments:
"filename "Text to prefix with"

an example run of the code will look like this:
"java -jar Prefixer.jar "C:\users\user\Documents\example.txt" Prefixer


Both arguments should be able to be passed without quotation marks unless you have whitespace in the file path or desired prefix string.
